# Aloha all,

As we head into the 20XX school year, I have a few announcements and reminders. For parents, if your children have not been in my classes before –  my name is Phoebe and I'll be teaching **4th grade general sciences** as well as **6th grade robotics** and **coding lab after school for 5-8th grade**.  
If you would like to see their syllabi ahead of time, please check the school's [LMS] site and navigate to my course(s).  


In the syllabus, you may notice the classroom has a specific procedure regarding devices. As soon as students arrive, they will need to:  
#### Deposit any electronic that connects to the internet via wifi, ethernet, cell service, or otherwise at the room's designated charging hub.  
This policy emerged through my experience teaching other STEM courses at this school during the final years in my bachelor's program, since I observed that unlimited access to students' personal devices could cause disruptions to the class. On the back of the same coin, being wholly unable to use electronics during the daytime would ultimately render students technologically illiterate and leave them  
at a greater disadvantage in modern skills compared to their peers in other programs.  
#### The solution? Allowing use of these devices in moderation during classtime, but only when relevant to the discussion or activity.


There is a decent chance you may have continually exposed your children to technology since a younger age than they are now, and perhaps you even raised an 'iPad kid'. This means that they will likely be able to bring their own devices to school at their own risk, as long as the equipment is to standard with the   school's regulation. However, if for any reason your student needs to temporarily rent or borrow a required device for the semester,  
#### Please contact the tech department to check their inventory for any available items that can be signed-out. 


#### Q: Why do I teach at all, and why STEM?  
A: As this set of topics (sometimes also now referred to as STEAM, with the arts added-on) becomes increasingly unavoidable and more information is accessible for public knowledge, the experts in these fields willing to teach the next generation become more scarce on a local level. I believe that preparing  
today's kids to become tomorrow's wise and knowledgeable leaders not only sets them up for success and improves the potential for their quality of life, but also in some way takes care of future us today by equipping the future adults with analytical skills to form intelligent thoughts, which directs them to make responsible decisions that produce favorable outcomes for everyone in their community regardless of age or generation.  

Looking forward to collaborating with all of you on your childrens' education this year and onward.

Sincerely,
Mx. Phoebe

# Class Policies

* Missed homework? 
    * It’s your grade, not mine. 
    * Exceptions can be made in extenuating circumstances but will require documented evidence (doctor’s note, obituary, etc.)

* Labs can be made up afterschool or at lunchtimes.
    * Please schedule with me and have your parents sign a form to approve extending or compensating for your learning time.

* Disrupting class? 
    * If you know so much that you don’t need to pay attention, come up to the front and teach it yourself!
    * (In cases where this goes surprisingly well, I can coach the student through and then have the class applaud them at the end of the lesson.)

* Trying to use your device outside of permitted time (or visiting unrelated sites/activities during classtime)? 
    * You’ll have to leave it at the hub and come back for it at the end of the day. 
    * Have fun explaining to your other teachers why you’re unprepared for their classes.

* If you’re called upon to "teach" due to disruptions more than 2x per week, you’ll have to make up the material you missed during morning breaks for the rest of the week.

* Incentive: students with the top grades in my class will get opportunities to have their projects showcased in relevant places or honored by the school
    * (ie. science fair, possibly district level, local robotics tournaments, etc.)
