# Aloha all,

BowFolios is an example web application that provides pages to view and (in some cases) modify profiles, projects, and interests. It illustrates various technologies useful to ICS software engineering students, including:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for Typescript-based implementation of client and server code.

## Community Feedback

Bowfolios is based upon [Next.js-application-template-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/Next.js-application-template-react/) and [Next.js-example-form-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/Next.js-example-form-react/). Please use the videos and documentation at those sites to better acquaint yourself with the basic application design and form processing in Bowfolios.

- Use of email-based password specification for users, and/or use of an alternative authentication mechanism.
- Use of https so that passwords are sent in encrypted format.
- Removal of the insecure package, and the addition of Next.js Methods to replace client-side DB updates.

<!-- ## Walkthrough videos

# Class Policies

* Missed homework? 
    * It’s your grade, not mine. 
    * Exceptions can be made in extenuating circumstances but will require documented evidence (doctor’s note, obituary, etc.)

* Labs can be made up afterschool or at lunchtimes
    * Please schedule with me and have your parents sign a form to approve extending or compensating for your learning time.

* Disrupting class? 
    * If you know so much that you don’t need to pay attention, come up to the front and teach it yourself!
    * (In cases where this goes surprisingly well, I can coach the student through and then have the class applaud them at the end of the lesson.)

* Trying to use your device outside of permitted time (or visiting unrelated sites/activities during classtime)? 
    * You’ll have to leave it at the hub and come back for it at the end of the day. 
    * Have fun explaining to your other teachers why you’re unprepared for their classes.

* If you’re called upon to "teach" due to disruptions more than 2x per week, you’ll have to make up the material you missed during morning breaks for the rest of the week.

* Incentive: students with the top grades in my class will get opportunities to have their projects showcased in relevant places or honored by the school
    * (ie. science fair, possibly district level, local robotics tournaments, etc.)
